Genetic Art
===========
A genetic art-making algorithm developed in conjunction with the final presentation for CS 105 Algorithms, at NYUAD 2015 by Frederik Jensen.

The purpose of this algorithm is to display how genetic algorithms work in a fun and intuitive way. Note that the code was quickly prototyped and is thus not the most polished one.

Documentation
=============
In order to run the application, do the following

* Clone or download the repository
* Navigate to the downloaded folder and open index.html in your browser.

Randomly genetic artworks are then displayed:

![Generation 0](https://github.com/frederikbrinck/genetic-art/blob/master/algo_start.png)

In order to drive forward your artwork generations, click on the artworks that you find the most beautiful. Then hit the *New Generation* button to produce a new generation consisting of the artworks you marked as fit. 

![Generation 1](https://github.com/frederikbrinck/genetic-art/blob/master/algo_gen1.png)

That's is! You can also play around with the mutation rate, look at the artworks' DNA strings, and see which artworks you have marked fit for the next generation.
